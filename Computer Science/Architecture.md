## Terminology

`PC` = Program Counter - Goes into memory and stores that information in the IR.

`IR` = Instruction Register - Takes the information from the PC and uses it to complete a task.

`Clock Cycle` = 1 instruction per clock cycle. A 1ghz is 1 billion clock cycles per second.

`Resgisters` = R0 - R7
