Landing a job takes between 90-180 days / 3-6 months.

Apply to 4-5 jobs a day, job burn-out is a thing so don't over-do it. Don't double-apply, keep track of where you're applying to.

**Know what the salaray is in your market before you start getting offers. KNOW WHAT YOU'RE WORTH!!**

In the software industry, contract and freelance work **are not negative**.

#### Apprenticeship (Long Term) vs Internship (Short Term)

Apprenticeships are usually more long-term, extremely detailed learning, usually paid and well help you get into a permanent position.

`GOOGLE JOBS`

**Only apply to jobs that have been open for 3 days or less** - If you try to apply past a week old, they are already interviewing. 7 days is usually the max.

`Huntr.co` - KhanBaan Board for Job Applications (easy way to track applications).

Limit 2-3 positions max in a single company that you're applying to.

Bold strats like contacting them and getting your name in there - this works best with start-ups and super small companies, bigger companies it won't work at all. Don't be aggressive with it.

#### Cold Outreach

Keep it short, 3-5 sentences.

Cold Outreach can be as simple as sending them a linkedin email.

You can contact the company through their "contact us" email, where you ask about the position and seeing if it's still open after you've applied

**Give them about a week before you follow up on an application - 6 to 7 days** - Unless you have personal contact with that person already, then about 2 days.

_Keep it Casual_

**Follow Up!**

**DON'T**

- Ask for a job
- Rant about yourself

**DON'T**
