# Interview Basics

Have copies of your resume with you on-hand.

15 minutes is good, never arrive too-early. If you're more than 20 minutes early walk around and take a breather, go to starbucks or something - DO NOT sit and wait.

**Ask a minimum of 3 questions, no more no less, at the end of the interview when they ask if you have any questions for them. Then ask for their card and an email so you can get ahold of them in the future if need-be.**
