Past Present Future --

Rather than saying you need to fix it, talk about how you're going to fix it. Turn the negative into a solution, always always provide a solution.

"In the future, the solution to this would probably be (blah blah blah)."

Don't forget to add some technical questions about your project - what you did to build it out, what solutions you have for bringing it up. Always talk about your indivual contribution.

"This is an app for not only seekers, but also employers."

"We used (items) to build it out, and I specially did a lot of the front-end work".

Condense it down!! It's basically Tinder for employers and future employees.

**Don't lean on or touch the desk!! It makes the webcam wobble!!!**

Never say "I don't know" **EVER**

"Well why did you do this rather than this?" Never say "because this was easier" or "this was faster".

"We had limited time and limited resources, so we used something that's efficient" or "The bulk of the team has experience in (x-framework) so we used something we were all familiar with". - And we know it can do (x-things) that we need it to do.

When you have to give a negative answer, always follow up with a solution. If they ask about something you don't know, relate it back to something you do know.
