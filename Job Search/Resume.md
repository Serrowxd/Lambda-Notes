# Resume Notes

Projects at the top of the resume

Projects should be the bulk of the resume

Project Name:

- a blurb about the function of the project

- how you built it out, if it was a team project talk about individual contribution

- the full tech stack used

(More WE instead of I did this) - Never put an end-date, always talk about like "Yeah I'm totally going to go back and do so and so whatever".

Remove the Summary -- Use that to fill out projects.
