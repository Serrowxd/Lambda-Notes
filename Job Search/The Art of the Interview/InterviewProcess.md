# The Interview Process

## Getting Ready

- Background Matters
- Lighting Matters
- Keep the camera about eye-level
- Stay still, sit up straight, make eye contact with the camera
- Find a box if you're using a laptop, put the camera at eye-level

## Nailing the Interview ~

- Never take a verbal agreement to salary over the phone, always ask for time to think about it.
- Arrive early, but not TOO early. 15 to 20 minutes to prepare yourself mentally and be punctual. Never arrive super early.
- Always have your resume prepared, but always bring a couple extra copies just incase - they'll probably have it printed out on file.

**USE STAR**
**Situation / Task / Action you Took / Results achieved** || **Always follow up a negative with a positive or results achieved**

**Tell me about yourself || Behavioral Interview**

- Elevator Pitch || Past, Preset, Future. What I did before engineering, what I want to do and why I want to do them, where I want to be and what I want to do. The future portion should be tailored to whoever you're interviewing with and the company.
- Always show that you've been doing research on the company, unique facts that are specific to the company. Their projects, and things that they are working on.
- Hype up Lambda, it's something you did 40+ hours a week for 7 months.
- **Keep the vibe positive**, don't trash talk previous employers. Always keep your message positive.
- Questions for your Interviewer - **at least 3 questions!!!!!**
- Thank everyone for their time, and **ASK QUESTIONS** - Make a mental note of next steps, get contact information so you can send thank you messages.

**If you get stuck on a coding problem, likek pairing, whiteboarding, etc., redo the problem when you get home and send the solution. It goes a long way**

**JOB OFFERS AND SALARY NEGOTIATIONS**

- AS SOON AS YOU GET THE OFFER, CONTACT SABRINA - SHE WILL HELP YOU.

_ALWAYS NEGOTIATE_ **ALWAYS**

- Your walk-away salary, add $10k. "If I can't take anything less than $70k, add $10k"
- If it's a range, add $15-$20k to your range.
- $65-$80k is your mid-market rate for most cities, **always know your min-market rate.**

~ Question - Don't take the first **offer**!!! We were told earlier that it's a good idea to try and grab the first offer we take ~

- Be prepared to walk away from offers.
- If they have a budget, understand that it might be the case, then ask for a possible 6 month performance review so you can revaluate salary. Sign-on Bonus?
- **IF YOU HAVE TO MOVE AND RELOCATE, GET A RELOCATION BONUS/ASSISTANCE!!!!!!!!!**
- Everything is negotiable, including Title.

~ Question, when negotiating and you bring up that you have a better offer somewhere else - like they are offering $75k, but I mention that I have an offer somewhere else at $85k. What if they ask what company it's from? How do you respond to that without coming off rude?

**I'm not comfortable sharing that at this time, is it possible to get you closer to $85k?**

~ Think of some questions you could ask the companies on your Huntr board ~
