#The Josh Experience

- Understand Taxes when doing Freelance work.
- Freelance at night, Salary during the day.

- If they make you sign a document that doesn't allow you to work freelance at night, you can request them to pay you more. Don't work for them if you are told that.

- Don't worry about your freelance if you're new, just work on your work and get a better job.

## Jump on the first job you find, don't be shy. So long as it's ethical and allows you to code, take it and go for it! Get your feet wet! You can always go upwards.

- I'll charge you 2500 to build a website. "Well I can just build it on Wix". Okay, I'll just you 500 to do that for you instead because most people can't do it.

- Freelance? Go find a charitable organization, someone that needs a website and build it for free. Get it on your resume, and give yourself a name. Build a website for a family member or someone in need.

- Work with friends if you can, but don't be greedy with the money. Split it 50/50 or 33/33/33 if you can. It's not always going to be easy, but it'll be worthwhile.
