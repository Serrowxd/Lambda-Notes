# The Brian Experience

When you're in an interview, you're there to interview them as well. The questions you ask back are your way to evaluate an employer.

Questions to ask:

"Should I start working for you, where would you see me in 5 years?"

Obviously don't just take the response as a deal breaker, get a feel for the whole conversation by the questions you ask because it is a two-way street afterall.

If you're working on gameplay and mechanics then you can just use premade models.

Unity is great and lightweight, Unreal is more multiplayer focused.

Looking for a job is hard and takes a lot of effort.

When you go into your job search, keep in mind it's going to take a lot applications.

"There is no such thing as done code, or something that you're satisified with"

You're never done, you just ran out of time and they take it away because it's good enough.
