# The Brian Experience

When you're in an interview, you're there to interview them as well. The questions you ask back are your way to evaluate an employer.

Questions to ask:

"Should I start working for you, where would you see me in 5 years?"

Obviously don't just take the response as a deal breaker, get a feel for the whole conversation by the questions you ask because it is a two-way street afterall.
