# The Ryan Experience

## Questions

#### 1

* Is it frowned upon to work later than you are scheduled for when working for a big company? Like say I'm stuck on something and I'm working through it to finish, but I was off and ready to head home about an hour ago. Is this something I would get yelled at for? If I'm not mistaken most of these jobs are salary based, so I can't imagine it would be an issue.

* On that same note, how does the scheduling work? Are you working (x) days a week or do you have like a set schedule you work under? Does it vary based on the company or is there like a set "amount of time" they want you to be there - fingers on keyboard.

### Task based mostly. You get work done in the time you're allotted - 80 hours for 2 weeks with a project kind of thing.

1.  You've taken on too much work
2.  The company is setting expectations too high.

* Run from companies that make you work more than 50-60 hours.
* Shoot for 40 hours, but you can work longer.

#### 2

* Do you choose jobs based on your strenghts? I'm very confident in React and would love to get a job in a more front-end based environment, while I'm not so confident in the back-end.

### Yes! Try to stick to where you'd like to be.I'll leave a job when I'm not having fun, and I'll leave a job when I'm bored with it. Those are my two criteria.

CEO: "Where's so and so"

Ryan: Well they finished, so they took the weekend early.

You fill your 40 hours and leave, unless you feel like you should stay later.

Stay well rounded, but also stay localized. **Always be learning, do something every single day as a developer that you didn't know how to do before**

Learn how to become comfortable with **fear**. It will be a part of your life forever.
