# Sandwitch

## Darryl Most:

### the trick is to be able to write the solution in english, for example

### translating the solution to a programming language afterward is trivial

### the most direct comparison i can think of is

### in most intro cs courses the professor will ask the class how to make a sandwich

### they'll say get bread, meat, lettuce, cheese etc

### and put those things inside the bread

### but the professor will say how do you get the bread

### they'll say you get the bag

### and then the professor says then what

### they have to say open it

### etc etc

### how detailed one goes

### the trick is that the computer needs a level of detail

### we're not at the state where we can say to the computer, make sandiwch

### we have to say, get bread, open bread bag, take 2 bread slices out, get ....

### very detailed

### if you can write your solutions in that methodical manner

### then it's easy to translate to code

### algorithm just stands for a detailed set of instructions

### imagine you're telling someone with 2 IQ how to do something

### and takes everything VERY literally

### that's basically computer programming at this point

### Hope that helps :D
