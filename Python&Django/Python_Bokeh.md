# Python + Bokeh

**When creating a new python project always `pipenv --three` to create a new pip file**

**When running a python file, you want to open the pipenv shell `pipenv shell`, then python src/draw.py**

**When installing files, you'll want to go into the `pipenv shell` and then use `pipenv install`**

**You can do mass-installs of dependencies by just copy and pasting them into the pipfile, then doing `pipenv install` -- or you can do `pipenv install` with them all on the same line - similar to NPM.**

[Bokeh](bokeh.pydata.org)

You can concatentate lists in Python with `+` - `debug_pallete += [a, b, c]`
