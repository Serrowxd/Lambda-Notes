## Commandline

`python -m pip install -U pip` - installs pip

`pip install pipenv` - installs pipenv

`python` - opens the python environment

`python src/hello_python.py` - runs python scripts at `python` then `directory/file.py`.

`pipenv --three` will create a pip environment specifically for python 3.

`pipenv shell` will open the pip shell.

**Note that this does not tell you when you are inside the shell, you will need to have a terminal specifically for it or you can run `pipenv shell` again to check.**
